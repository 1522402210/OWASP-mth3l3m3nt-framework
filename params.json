It fosters a principle of attack the web using the web as well as pentest on the go.\r\n\r\nModules Packed in so far are: \r\n* Payload Store\r\n* Shell Generator (PHP/ASP/JSP/JSPX)\r\n* Payload Encoder and Decoder (Base64/Rot13/Hex/Hexwith \\x seperator/ Hex with 0x Prefix)\r\n* CURL GUI (GET/POST)\r\n* LFI Exploitation module (currently prepacked with: Koha Lib Lime LFI/ Wordpress Aspose E-book generator LFI/ Zimbra Collaboration Server LFI)\r\n* HTTP Bot Herd to control web shells. \r\n\r\nCurrently it is set to use a flat file database. \r\n\r\nCopy all the files into your webroot except db_dump_optional\r\n\r\nEnsure the Folders Below are writeable: \r\n\r\n* tmp\r\n* framework/data\r\n* framework/data/site_config.json\r\n\r\nIt should run from the get go All just navigate to it.\r\n\r\nthe login url is: /cnc\r\n\r\nusername:mth3l3m3nt\r\npassword:mth3l3m3nt\r\n\r\nBy Default I have set it to use the JIG database but this you can change at any point in the backend. \r\nThe DB Dump in place is for users who use MySQL and need demo data. Unfortunately I have only done for MySQL. It's my DB of choice. \r\n\r\nAlternatively watch the installation here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8peOGsl5TC4WscgWaNMx0xJlS6X2QJI0\r\n\r\nIf you would like to switch from JIG you can do so in the settings. Please note the DB has to be created, it only populates it with the required tables, it doesn't drop or create the DB , other supported Databases are: \r\n\r\n* Mongo DB \r\n* MSSQL\r\n* PostgreSQL\r\n* SQLite\r\n* MySQL\r\n\r\nOther than SQLite please ensure that you have the PHP extensions for the Databases above so that it can access them through PHP Data Objects.\r\n\r\nFor MySQL users needing MySQL Sample Data like alot of it especially payloads switch the database to MySQL and import data from the Dump to populate.\r\n\r\nIncase of questions or suggestions or bugs and what nots:\r\nhttp://munir.skilledsoft.com\r\n\r\nIt's been tested on : \r\n\r\n* Apache \r\n* Lightspeed\r\n* Lighttpd\r\n\r\nIncase you test on another server please give your review.\r\n\r\nIf installing it in a subfolder edit the .htaccess file to reflect the RewriteBase as the subfolder.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
